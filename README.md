# microDOT_Clock
WiFi Chronometer from NTP Server
This is a retro display clock design LTP-305.
For the project I used ESP8266 and a ready-made MicroDOT display.
The clock reads the time from the NTP server and displays updates every second.
To configure the WiFi connection I used the ready-made "WiFi Configuration Magic library".
